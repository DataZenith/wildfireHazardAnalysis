# Wildfire Hazard Risk Analysis

This repository contains the code and documentation used to analyze wildfire hazard risk datasets provided by the Wildfire Hazard Risk Point of contact (POC) at Oregon State. The analysis focuses on classifying burn areas, evaluating the distribution of burn probability estimates across fire and non-fire zones, and quantifying the percentage overestimate of predicted burn probabilities.

## Repository Overview

Due to file size limitations, the actual raw datasets are not stored in this repository. Instead, links to the original and transformed data sources are provided below. The repository contains all the code (scripts and notebooks) used to process, analyze, and visualize the data, along with documentation that explains the methodology in accessible terms.

## Data Sources

1. **Transformed Data**  
   - **Description:**  
      This dataset is derived from a combination of **burn probability estimates** from the wildfire hazard model and **historical wildfire records**. Each row in the dataset represents a single **pixel** where these two datasets overlap. The dataset includes:  
   - **Burn Probability:** The probability of fire occurrence for that pixel, as assigned by the wildfire hazard model.
   - **Wildfire Hazard :** The final hazard scores of the model output.  These do not have the applied averaging by taxlot which is the final step in estimating wildfire hazard.
   - **Fire Occurrence Flag:** A binary indicator (1 = fire occurred, 0 = no fire) derived from historical wildfire data.  
   - **Spatial Resolution:** Each pixel is spaced **500 feet apart** both vertically and horizontally, ensuring a uniform grid structure.

2. **Oregon State Wildfire Hazard Data**  
   - **Description:**  
     This primary dataset is provided by Oregon State and was used to build the wildfire hazard model.

3. **Historical Fire Data**  
   - **Description:**  
     This dataset contains historical fire events, which were used to validate and compare with the model outcomes.  This dataset contains recorded wildfire events from **2000 to 2021** and was used to validate the modelâ€™s predictive accuracy. The dataset includes only fire events where **acres burned exceeded 247**, ensuring that only significant fire occurrences were considered. To maintain the focus on naturally occurring and uncontrolled wildfire events, **prescribed burns and resource management fires were excluded** from the analysis.

## Code and Analysis Description

The code in this repository is organized to support reproducibility and transparency. It specifically performs the following analyses:

- **Classification of Burn Areas, Histogram comparison, and Percentile Comparison:**
   - **File:** `prob.py`  
     The code identifies and categorizes regions based on burn data, distinguishing between areas that have experienced fire and those that have not, studies histogram probabilities of fire/no fire, and shows the thershold percentials from the WUI subset and the full data.

- **Hazard Value Overestimation Analysis:**
  - **File:** `hazard.py`  
     I evaluate relative hazard within each risk band and estimate the long run overestimation of each risk band.



### Programs Used

- **QGIS:**  
  QGIS, a free and open-source geographic information system, was used for spatial data analysis and visualization.  
  Download QGIS from [qgis.org](https://qgis.org/en/site/).

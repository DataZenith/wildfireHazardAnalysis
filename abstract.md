# **Under Fire: Rethinking Wildfire Predictions**  
### **Abstract**  

</div>

This abstract summarizes a long-run evaluation of the **accuracy, classification performance, and threshold validity** of Oregon’s Wildfire Hazard Risk Map using **21 years of wildfire data**. The findings reveal that the model systematically **overestimates burn probability**, inflating long-term fire likelihood by approximately **78%**. Additionally, within its highest risk category, the model **overestimates extreme fire risk by 74%**, indicating a persistent pattern of overprediction across risk levels.

Most critically, the model fails to distinguish between **fire-prone and non-fire zones** over a long history of data. A robust wildfire risk model should indicate that areas classified as **high hazard** have historically experienced more fire than low-risk areas. However, this model does not meet that expectation. Instead, its classification performance is **statistically indistinguishable from that of a random number generator**, meaning it offers no meaningful ability to separate areas that have burned from those that have not, **undermining its utility as a predictive tool**.

Compounding this issue, the model's **hazard classification thresholds** lead to **extreme overclassification**. The **high hazard threshold (0.13787)**, originally set at the **90th percentile** within the **wildland-urban interface (WUI)**, corresponds to the **40th percentile** when applied to the full dataset. This means that nearly **60% of tax lots** are classified as high hazard instead of the intended **10%**, drastically inflating perceived wildfire risk across the state. Given the model’s **inability to differentiate between fire and non-fire areas**, this overclassification suggests that hazard values do not reflect actual fire history.

These findings collectively highlight fundamental flaws in the model’s **burn probability estimates, classification performance, and threshold calibration**. Given that this evaluation is based on **long-term wildfire data spanning over two decades**, the results underscore the necessity of **validating wildfire risk models against extended historical datasets** to ensure their **predictive reliability and policy relevance** over time.
